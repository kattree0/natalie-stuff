    <h1>Natalie</h1>
    <p>As of right now my major is computer science. I might end up like a fair amount of CompSci majors and end up chanigng my major. </p>
   <p>My hobbies are drawing, gaming, and reading mangas.</p>
   <p>The advantages of learning about careers in this field will help me to know what is out there. I am taking it because it is a requirement for my major. I hope to be able to better understand html and css so I can to help my brother create a website for his business.</p>
   <p>My favourite scripture is John 14:18</p>

   <p> A silly little fact about this image: This was when I messed with one of my high school's PCs so it could run Steam games on it.</p>
