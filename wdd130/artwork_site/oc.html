            <p>I was making opposite characters and this was one of the few that I liked.             <a href = "https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/796239726167851058/1277090782704304239/Untitled388_20240824221942.png?ex=673c9f39&is=673b4db9&hm=d3bc6fb24342423bb26938508be05a07c2b43576183792af559d89bace49c72f&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=299&height=399" target ="_blank">This</a> is his original design; his clothes have changed since then because the og one looked too weird imo. His hair will also change because I was told that it was unnatural.</p>

            <p>I was getting a laptop for college right? I didn't want some crusty background for it, so I made one with some of my OCs. I would have included more, but I knew I would struggle drawing that much. This one has myself, Yabom, Illumi, kattree, and kattree.</p>

            <p>The whole backstory of Skylar is that he's saving people from various war-torn planets. This is an example of one. He is saving kattree in this one, and yes he is very worried(he kind of finds her cute so that isn't helping his nerves.)</p>

I determined that it would be cool to have my own masked character.

            <p>According to myself, this is based off of a dream and a song? I don't know what song? I remember the dream but not the song blehhh. I did make a             <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyFGho_4IdM" target ="_blank"> timelapse </a> of it though!! Ignore the fact I open discord :sob:</p>

            <p>I was originally going to commission someone to make this for me, but I liked me little sketch too much that I decided to make it myself. I made it to place an image of a game in the monitor and send it to friends whenever I wanted to play that game with them. It was quite effective in practice.</p>
