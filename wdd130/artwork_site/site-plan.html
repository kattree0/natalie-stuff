      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This will be a description of who I am as an artist, and why I got into art. It will also list various stages of my art journey that I have been on. These may include, but are not limited to my anthropomorphic animal phase, dream phase, men phase, etc. I will also have an image of the latest artwork I have completed and possibly a random doodle. I will also include an image of myself. I would do this to inform those who visit this page a nice description of myself, so they can get an understanding of why I create the artworks that I do. 
</p>
<p>I will also have a section of why I got into drawing. I will include my process of getting better, and why I chose to continue drawing for the years. I will also include the different mediums and why I decided to stick with just digital art for my main form of expression.
