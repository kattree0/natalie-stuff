    <p class = "intro">Hi! I'm kattree! I draw art if you couldn't tell hehe. I'm 19 years old. I have been drawing since I was about 11 years old. I also like computers which is why I am studying cyber security! I mainly started off drawing animals from the game Animal Jam. But I eventually moved on to humans. I never really did any real art study over these years, and that's why my art isn't as good as it could be. I still adore my style, so I don't plan on changing it anytime soon.  </p>

    <h2>Why draw?</h2>
    <p>     Why did I start drawing you may ask? Well I found this random social media platform called Amino and it had a subsection for Animal Jam. I looked at it and I was amazed by all the different artworks. Little me saw that and thought "I wanna do that!!" So I installed a drawing app and drew a little blue wolf. It was awful, but I thought it was the best thing ever. I continued on drawing various animals from this game Animal Jam. Eventually I grew out of that game, and moved on to drawing humans. I watched the Minecraft Youtuber Dream a lot, so during quarentine, all I did was draw him and his friends. That was able to propel my art skills forward. I eventually stopped drawing them, and I instead drew my friends and their characters. Then I discovered what creativity was lol and I started making my own characters!! That is still what I primarily like drawing today(and of course the random things I am interested in.)</p>
