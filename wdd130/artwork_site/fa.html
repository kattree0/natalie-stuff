            <p>This was created based off a prompt a random Russian on steam gave me. It read "Yes, I’m Russian, this style came about when I was riding a bear, I had vodka in one hand and a drawing tablet in the other. :p2chell:" Here is the link to that if you are curious.             <a href = "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3283373103" target ="_blank">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3283373103</a>

            <img src="images/FA/cs_wherearewegoing.webp" alt="Defult T-side guy from cs2 looking cutesy">
            <p>I had taken an interest in the design of the terrorist characters in the game Counter-Strike 2. I decided to draw him in a cutesy fashion because it is an interesting contrast to his job. I had also thought of him as cute at the time as well (Don't worry, I do NOT find his actions cute though) </p>

            <p>This is Mirage from Apex Legends. He at this time was my favourite legend to play, so I really wanted to draw him. I asked my friend what I should draw of him doing, and she told me to draw him in a dress. I'm not sure how easy it would be to win the Apex Games in a dress but he's slaying.</p>

            <p>I wanted to draw gun. I also like PVZGW(my favourite game). So I drew the cactus(a character designed to be played at long range) holding a sniper rifle. Also here is a random             <a href = "https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/701924343751376936/1208595885496336384/image.png?ex=673d44a1&is=673bf321&hm=8ba590650efab25e0484077e5422d2734b09cc19c2647e86c556243fb5cac344&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=448&height=399">WIP</a>

            <p>My friends and I decided one night at around 12am to start roleplaying in Counter-Strike 2. The two on the left are Jim and Buster Duster. The two on the right are Big and Little Tooth Tim. Buster Duster is chatting with the terrorists and Jim is pissed because his partner is not doing is job. Fun Fact- Their eyes match the people who played them. </p>

            <img src="images/FA/lethal_company.webp" alt="A blob, bracken, and spider play poker with a dead employee in the background.">
            <p>"because the creatures have always been apart of the boys?" I made this whenever I had barely played lethal company for 10 hours. I included only the creatures and loot I had come across(which was very small in comparison to what the game had to offer). This was way too much fun to make, and I really really like how it turned out.

            <p>I was watching this Russian cartoon and showed an end image of a knight giving a princess some jelly. I liked the way it looked, and I decided to create it in my own style.</p>

            <p>Joe Hawley is one of the members of my favourite band Tally Hall. He is most certainly the silliest and most out of pocket in there, and that's why he's my favourite! He's got fun hair to draw too.</p>
